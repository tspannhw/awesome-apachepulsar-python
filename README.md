Apache Pulsar Development 101 with Python
In this session I will get you started with real-time cloud native streaming programming with Python.

We will start off with a gentle introduction to Apache Pulsar and setting up your first easy standalone cluster. We will then l show you how to produce and consume message to Pulsar using several different Python libraries including Python client, websockets, MQTT and even Kafka.

After this session you will be building real-time streaming and messaging applications with Python.
